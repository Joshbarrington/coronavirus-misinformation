Don‚Äôt fall for this coronavirus epidemic! The key: Boost your immune system naturally!

Have you ever wondered why they make such a big deal about this coronavirus ‚Äúepidemic‚Äù?

Look at this article to find out:

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/coronavirus-highlights-the-dollar35-billion-vaccine-market-here-are-the-key-players/ar-BB10ilBg?ocid=spartanntp

‚ÄúThe vaccine market has grown sixfold over the past two decades, worth more than $35 billion today, according to AB Bernstein. The firm said the industry has consolidated to four big players that account for about 85% of the market ‚Äî British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, French pharmaceutical company Sanofi, and U.S.-based Merck and Pfizer.

‚ÄúFor every dollar invested in vaccination in the world‚Äôs 94 lowest-income countries, the net return is $44.‚Äù

There you here, we have the answer: it is all about money!

And I wonder why people do not see that‚Ä¶ It is so obvious!

And more concerning is this:

‚ÄúA SINISTER plot to secretly inject tiny identity microchips into people while they receive inoculations against diseases will start within weeks‚Äù, a former politician has extraordinarily claimed.‚Äù

It is called project ID2020. Is this the mark of the beast?

After all the rhetoric and theories, Coronavirus is a genuine threat, and it‚Äôs likely that you and I will be exposed.

It is in the USA now, and several cases have been diagnosed already.

It‚Äôs a ‚Äúnew‚Äù type of Coronavirus

Coronaviruses are a group of viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that are typically mild, such as the common cold, though rarer forms such as SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 can be lethal.

In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China. On 31 December 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of Coronavirus, which was given the interim name 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization (WHO), later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Some researchers have suggested that the Huanan Seafood Market may not be the original source of viral transmission to humans.

As of 6 March 2020, there have been at least 3,286 confirmed deaths and more than 95,748 confirmed cases in the coronavirus pneumonia outbreak. In the US, there are about 60 cases in California.

The Wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of Betacoronavirus from group 2B with an ~70% genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV. The virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.

According to Forbes magazine, there are two strains of this virus, one that is more aggressive than the other.

There are yet to be vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections. In addition, wearing masks do not afford protection.

And no, you can‚Äôt get this virus from drinking a Corona. üòä

Infections range from mild to serious. The virus can turn deadly if it leads to pneumonia, respiratory failure, or septic shock. Those most at risk of death are the elderly and people with weakened immune systems.

The outbreak quickly moved from China around the world. It spreads the same way other coronaviruses do: through person-to-person contact.

Symptoms can show up anywhere from 2 to 27 days after exposure. Early on, they‚Äôre a lot like the common cold. You might notice:

Fever
Dry Cough
Shortness of breath
As modern science scrambles to develop a vaccine (many months away), as governments employ the ineffective quarantines, and as the public worries more each day; there is already a viable solution within our immediate reach. It comes by consensus and experience from functional medicine doctors from all around the world.

Quarantines do not work simply because we can‚Äôt stop any movement as Dr. Brewer explains:

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a globally connected society today. It‚Äôs difficult to have an effective quarantine,‚Äù said Timothy Brewer, professor of medicine and a member of the Division of Infectious Diseases at UCLA‚Äôs David Geffen School of Medicine. ‚ÄúFor a quarantine to really be effective, you have to be able to prevent any movement. That‚Äôs very difficult to do in this day and age.‚Äù

In addition, the incubation time of this virus is up to 27 days. In other words, it can take up to 27 days before you actually have symptoms of the infection. 27 days is a very long time and that person could have potentially infected hundreds of other people.

Although they‚Äôve given you some pretty important tips for PREVENTING the Coronavirus, they have missed one important aspect:

Strengthening your immune system!

Having a stronger immune system could go a long way to fighting off nasty pathogenic terrors that could make you sick.

Look‚Ä¶it‚Äôs that time of year where everyone is getting sick. And the more preventative measures you can take now to stop the spread of these viruses, the better off you are.

And if you happen to get sick, it would be better to have it for a few days than a few weeks, am I right?

As always, we must first ensure personal immune integrity. There‚Äôs a list of scientifically-backed, vitally-important nutrients that people can take right now to better ensure their body‚Äôs ability to respond and properly minimize the impact.

Vitamin C is very important for viral infection prevention:

Elderberry has been shown to kill viruses:

Echinacea strengthens your immune system to fight viruses:

Andrographis has been shown to defend our body against the flu:

Ganoderma is a strong immune system booster:

Vitamin D has anti-flu properties:

Probiotics regulate the immune system and boost it:

Zinc

Pau d‚ÄôArco

Garlic

Cat‚Äôs claw

Astragulus

These herbs or products are a good way to strengthen your immune system and minimize your risks of getting this virus.

In addition, diet is very important. Dairy products, sugar, and wheat are to be eliminated out of your diet. These foods are known to reduce the ability of your immune system to fight infections. You can read more about this phenomenon here:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29727694

Finally, you can add coconut oil to your diet is known to have antimicrobial properties.

In addition, free chlorine was found to inactivate SARS-CoV better than chlorine dioxide. Free residue chlorine over 0.5 mg/L for chlorine or 2.19 mg/L for chlorine dioxide in wastewater ensures complete inactivation of SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Chlorine is added to our water and therefore it kills the virus!

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15847934

Household products like Lysol and Purell have been shown also to kill the virus.

I hope this clarifies a few misconceptions about the coronavirus and how to fight it naturally!
